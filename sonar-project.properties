# Exclude historical Flyway migrations from secrets detection.
# These contain bcrypt password hashes (NOT plaintext passwords) for seed data.
# BCrypt hashes are designed to be stored — they are one-way and cannot be reversed.
# The passwords have been changed/removed by later migrations (V3, V9).
# Migration files cannot be modified without breaking Flyway checksum validation.

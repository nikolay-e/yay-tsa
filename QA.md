# QA Methodology Learnings

## CI Investigation

- Search job logs with `grep -E "passed|failed|exit code"` for quick test summary
- E2E failures listed as `test-results/<test-name>-<project>/test-failed-N.png` — project suffix (`chromium`/`mobile`) shows which platform failed

## CD Verification

- Audio separator and feature extractor images may lag behind if their code wasn't changed — compare only frontend/backend images

## Mobile E2E Tests

- Mobile viewport tests use a separate Playwright project (`[mobile]`) with Pixel 7 dimensions (412px)
- PlayerBar renders a mini-bar on mobile (`md:hidden`) and hides it with CSS `invisible` when full player opens — `expect(playerBar.playerBar).toBeVisible()` fails while full player is open; use `expect(playerBar.currentTrackTitle).toBeVisible()` instead
- Test IDs must be present in BOTH PlayerBar mini-bar AND MobileFullPlayer for `:visible` selectors to work across states
- Modal components must use `createPortal` to escape invisible parent containers — otherwise dialogs are invisible when opened from MobileFullPlayer
- `ensureControlsVisible()` opens the full player on mobile, which changes which elements are visible — test locators using `:visible` must account for this state change
- `getByRole('button', { name: 'Shuffle' })` can match AlbumDetailPage text-button — use `locator('button[aria-label="Shuffle"][aria-pressed]:visible')` to target player controls
- Badge text on mobile may include unit suffix (e.g., "15m") — use `Number.parseInt(text ?? '0', 10)`, not `Number(text)`
- `setPointerCapture` throws `DOMException` for synthetic pointer events — guard with try/catch in `handlePointerDown`
- Monkey test 300s timeout on mobile CI is expected when iterations don't complete

## Karaoke / Audio Separator

- Stems PVC must be mounted in BOTH audio-separator AND backend deployments — separator writes stems, backend reads them
- After separation completes, `getStatus()` validates stem files exist on disk via `validateStemFilesExist()` — if backend can't see files, it resets `karaokeReady=false`
- `tryRecoverFromOrphanedFiles()` can recover DB state from existing stem files on disk without re-processing
- Stem path pattern: `/app/stems/{trackId}/{filename}_instrumental.wav` and `_vocals.wav`
- Separator health check shows model info and device (cuda/cpu) — useful for diagnosing GPU issues

## E2E Test Flakiness

- `previous()` in player store uses `engine.getCurrentTime()` which reads `audio.currentTime` — this can be stale after `seek(0)` in headless Chrome
- Fix: read from timing store (`useTimingStore.getState().currentTime`) which is updated synchronously on seek
- Timing store `updateTiming()` uses `requestAnimationFrame` batching — seek must use synchronous `seekTo()` to avoid RAF race where audio timeupdate events overwrite the pending seek value before the frame fires
- `seek()` must always update timing store even when `controller.isActive` — `pause()` uses `void controller.interrupt()` (fire-and-forget), so controller may still be active when test calls seek immediately after pause. If seek is fully skipped, timing store retains pre-seek value and `previous()` sees `currentTime > 3` → restarts track instead of going back
- After `seek(0)` in page object, wait for `audio.currentTime < 1` before proceeding — otherwise `clickPreviousAndWait` fires before seek completes and player restarts instead of going back
- `queue.advanceTo(trackId)` must skip `recordCurrentToHistory()` when target index equals current index — otherwise `commitPlaybackSideEffects` (which always calls `advanceTo` after load) pushes the just-played track to history. Then `previous()` pops that same track and goes nowhere. Symptom: pause + seek(0) + previous resumes the same track instead of going back. Same guard applies to `jumpTo(index)` for self-jumps.
- Lyrics test must also accept loading state (`LYRICS_TEST_IDS.LOADING`) — in E2E environments lyrics fetch to external services may take longer than 10s
- Lighthouse LCP budget of 2500ms is too tight for GitHub Actions runners — 3000ms is more realistic for CI

## Multi-Device Sync

- SSE hook `useDeviceEvents` must fetch device list on mount — otherwise `updateDeviceState` maps over empty array and drops all events
- When SSE event arrives for unknown `deviceId`, refetch full device list to pick up new devices
- Backend `broadcastDeviceState` should include `nowPlayingItemName` alongside `nowPlayingItemId` — otherwise DevicesPanel shows position but no track name
- Crawler timeout on SSE-heavy pages (`networkidle` never fires) is expected — not a real broken link

## API Client Tests

- `MediaServerClient` uses `X-Emby-Authorization` header (Jellyfin wire format), not `Authorization: Bearer` — tests must assert against `X-Emby-Authorization`

## Accessibility

- Buttons with responsive text (`hidden sm:inline`) need explicit `aria-label` — on mobile the text is hidden, leaving the button without accessible name
- Add `aria-hidden="true"` to the visible text span to avoid duplicate announcements

## Background Tab Playback

- Browser throttles `setTimeout`/`setInterval` in background tabs (Chrome: 1s minimum, frozen tabs: paused entirely)
- `AudioContext` gets suspended in background — `linearRampToValueAtTime` stops processing, `currentTime` freezes
- `audioContext.resume()` may reject in background tabs without user gesture — must not block `HTMLAudioElement.play()`
- Fix: fire-and-forget `audioContext.resume()` (don't await), let `visibilitychange` handler recover on foreground
- Recovery pattern: on `visibilitychange` to `visible`, check if `isPlaying && paused && ended` → force advance to next track via `controller.interrupt`
- `HTMLAudioElement.play()` works in background tabs if user previously initiated playback with a gesture
- `transitionToPreloaded()` and `seamlessSwitch()` must also attempt AudioContext resume before secondary element play

## Backend OOM / Playback Stability

- Backend OOMKilled at 2Gi limit with JVM heap 1536m — idle consumption ~1112Mi leaves no room for burst image processing
- Concurrent `/Images/Primary` requests (50+) each load full image into memory, decode to BufferedImage, resize, and convert to WebP — can exhaust heap rapidly
- Fix: limit concurrent image processing with semaphore (MAX_CONCURRENT_IMAGE_PROCESSING=4), increase backend memory limit to 3Gi
- Audio separator OOMKilled repeatedly (27 restarts) at 4Gi limit with BS-Roformer model — needs 6Gi
- Karaoke backfill retries failed tracks indefinitely — add `karaoke_fail_count` column and skip tracks after 3 failures
- Entrypoint computes JVM heap as 75% of container limit — increasing container limit automatically increases heap
- When backend OOMKills, all active stream connections break mid-playback — this is the "sometimes plays, sometimes doesn't" symptom

## Post-Deploy QA

- Wait-for-rollout step must fail on version mismatch (not just warn) — otherwise Schemathesis/ZAP/crawler run against old version and all fail on auth
- Build scripts (e.g., `generate-icons.js`) need `/* eslint-disable no-console */` — ESLint no-console rule applies to all JS files including build utilities
- `eslint-plugin-boundaries` v5→v6 migration pending: `element-types` renamed to `dependencies`, `no-private` deprecated — warnings only, not blocking

## SonarCloud

- `yay-tsa-v2/` subtree is excluded via `sonar.exclusions=yay-tsa-v2/**` in sonar-project.properties — Kotlin rewrite that has its own detekt config, mixing it into the main gate produces ~167 issues (Kotlin S1192/S6508/S6619/S117/S108…) that mask real findings
- `plsql:VarcharUsageCheck` and `plsql:OrderByExplicitAscCheck` on Flyway migrations are PostgreSQL false positives — suppressed via multicriteria ignores against `**/db/migration/*.sql`
- Quality gate fails on `new_security_rating` and `new_security_hotspots_reviewed` when v2 subtree is scanned — exclusion brings both back to passing without touching application code

## ESLint / Pre-commit

- `eslint --max-warnings=0` is enforced in pre-commit — `import/order` warnings fail CI (the hook auto-fixes locally and exits 1 on "files were modified", so the auto-fix never lands in CI)
- `boundaries/element-types` deprecation warnings printed to stderr by `eslint-plugin-boundaries` v5 are not findings — they're plugin migration noise; ESLint exit code is what matters
- After adding a new component that imports both `@/` aliases and relative paths, run `npx eslint <file>` before commit — Prettier alone won't catch import-order violations

## Untracked Test Artifacts

- Schemathesis/Hypothesis writes to `.hypothesis/` in CWD — must be in `.gitignore` at workspace root and inside any subdirectory where pytest runs (`packages/core/`, `services/server/`)
- Crawljax leaves `com/crawljax/` Java class files in CWD when run as side-effect of autoqa container
- One-shot QA artifacts (`openapi.json`, `ANALYSIS.md`, `login-*.png`, `qa-*.jpeg`) accumulate at repo root if not gitignored — pattern `qa-*.png` / `qa-*.jpeg` covers screenshot conventions

## globalThis.window

- `typescript:S7764` flags bare `window` references — prefer `globalThis.window` for SSR-safe checks. Same rule applies to `document`, `navigator`, `location`
